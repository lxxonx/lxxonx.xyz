## Bio

<p>
Major in Business, Minor in Computer Science.
</p>
<p>
I love to work with people and solve problems. When other teams are having trouble with their work, I like to help them out and solve the problem together. I also like to work with people who are better than me. I think it's a great opportunity to learn from them and improve myself.
</p>
<p>
I'd like to work efficiently and effectively. I have set up an automated deployment system using Ansible and Terraform to reduce the time it takes to deploy a server. I also have experience in building a CI/CD system using Github Actions and AWS CodeDeploy.
