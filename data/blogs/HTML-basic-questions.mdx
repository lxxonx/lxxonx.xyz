15. Explain the concept of web storage in HTML5
    - With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser.
    - Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.
    - Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.
    - Web storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.

16. Explain Meta tags
    - The `<meta>` tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.
    - `<meta>` tags always go inside the `<head>` element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
    - Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
    - Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
    - There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the `<meta>` tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).
    - ref: [HTML Meta Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp)
